# tsl-interpreter
A simple interpreter for TSL (Tiny Student Language, a sublanguage of Racket) written in Python

Concept based on a bonus lecture by Gregor Kiczales for CPSC 110: Computation, Programs, and Programming in the fall term of 2019 at the University of British Columbia, where an interpreter for a similar language was written in Racket ([Starter](https://edx-course-spdx-kiczales.s3.amazonaws.com/HTC/lecture/lec24-eval-starter.rkt), [Solution](https://edx-course-spdx-kiczales.s3.amazonaws.com/HTC/lecture/lec24-eval-solution.rkt)).
